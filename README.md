# Modeling Type 1 Diabetes progression using machine-learning and single-cell transcriptomic measurements in human islets

## Windows or Linux or Mac users
R v 4.1.2 was used to develop the models. All the package versions can be found in the manuscript.
Some of the key packages used are mentioned below- 
  ```install.packages("Seurat")```
